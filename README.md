## 🤝 Join the Mission: Let's Build "Real" Tech

**🚧 Status: Learning Prototype / Alpha**

Hey there, Developer! 👋

I built MegaBlog as a portfolio project to master the modern web stack. While it has some cool features, **it is far from perfect.** There are bugs, unoptimized code blocks, and UI improvements needed.

**But that's the point.**

I don't want to just show you code; I want to build a **Community of Learners**.

### 💡 Why Contribute?

* **Fix the Broken:** Find a bug? Don't just report it—teach me how to fix it!
* **Add the Missing:** Think we need *Dark Mode* toggle or *Voice Search*? Build it with me.
* **Learn Together:** Let's discuss architecture, best practices, and scalable code in the Issues tab.

**My Vision:** I want to turn this "Learning Project" into a **Production-Grade Open Source CMS**. If you are a beginner looking for your first PR, or a pro wanting to mentor—**You are welcome here.**

Let's turn this code into a legacy. 🚀
